# CSV Parser Architecture & Systems Design Breakdown

**📁 Portfolio Context:** This repository is a technical analysis and documentation of a Java data processing system I built for an academic project. It contains architecture documentation, design pattern explanations, performance analysis, and illustrative code samples.

## Code Review & Verification

Due to academic integrity policies, the original source code resides in a private university repository. However, I am happy to:

1.  Provide specific, **redacted code excerpts** upon request to illustrate particular implementations.
2.  Walk through the **entire codebase live in a screen-shared technical interview**.
3.  Discuss any aspect of the architecture, algorithms, or design decisions in detail.

My goal is to be as transparent as possible within academic boundaries.

## Overview
This documentation breaks down a Java application that processes Philadelphia city data through a custom-built CSV parser, API integration, and optimized data structures. The project implemented multiple design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Strategy) and performance optimizations including memoization.

## What You'll Find Here

### 1. Architecture Documentation
- **System Design**: Layered architecture with clear separation of concerns
- **Design Patterns**: Implementation details of Singleton, Factory, and Strategy patterns
- **Data Flow**: How data moves through parsing, processing, and output layers

### 2. Performance Analysis
- **Data Structure Optimization**: Why `HashMap` beat `ArrayList` for header lookups

### 3. Technical Deep Dives
- **Custom CSV Parser**: State machine design for handling quoted fields and escapes

### 4. Code Samples & Concepts
- **Illustrative Examples**: Clean-room code demonstrating key techniques
- **Design Decisions**: Why certain architectures were chosen over alternatives

## Key Technical Skills Demonstrated
- **Systems Architecture**: Layered design, separation of concerns
- **Performance Engineering**: Data structure selection, algorithm optimization
- **Design Patterns**: Practical application of GoF patterns
- **API Design**: REST integration, error handling, fallback strategies

## How to Engage with This Portfolio
1. **Review Architecture Diagrams**: Understand the system design
2. **Read Performance Analysis**: See the impact of optimization decisions
3. **Request a Live Walkthrough**: I'm available for technical discussions about any aspect

*Note: This repository contains analysis, documentation, and illustrative examples only. The complete academic implementation remains private per university policy.*
